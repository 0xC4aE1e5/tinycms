## Notes:
- The default password is `root`. Do not enter a username.
## After install
1. Change the password. You put the password in the file `password`. Note that it's unencrypted, but they can't see it. (that is, when you run PHP in the `site` folder). Make sure the file has a single line ending, and that it's a Unix line ending.

2. Open the admin page. To do that, go to `/admin/`. The extra `/` is important, because the site doesn't work properly.

3. Edit the home page. Just press `edit`. You will get a WYSIWYG (essentially Microsoft Word) editor.

4. Publish! Just press `publish & return`!
